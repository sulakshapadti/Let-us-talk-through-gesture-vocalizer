"Let us talk through gesture vocalizer" is an IoT based project Which Recognizes the Sign language gestures and produce outputin the form of text and voice using the mobile application.
Hardware Coonnection:
Attach Copper sheets to each figer tips and place jumper wires to each fingers.

1} Arduino Nano:
i) Thumb finger - GND
ii) Index finger - A0
iii) Middle finger - A1
iv) Ring finger -A2
v) Pinky finger - A3

2} Accelerometer(ADXL335}:
X-pin - A5
Y-pin - A6
Z-pin - A7
VCC   - 5v
GND   - GND

3)Bluetooth Module(HC-05):
Arduino Nano TX pin - RX pin
VCC  - SV
GND   - GND

Steps:
1) First we require hardwares like, Arduino Naano, Accelerometer(ADXL335), Bluetooth module(HC_05), Copper sheets, Jumper wires, and a Hand glove.
2) Connect the Harwares as per the cicuit diagram.
3) Code the Arduino Nano using arduino IDE.
4) Complile and upload the code in to Arduino Nano.
5) In your android device turn on bluetooth.
6) Pair the Bluetooth module(HC-05) to your device using password "1234" or "0000".
7) Download and install Android App "Arduino Bluetooth Text to Speech" apk file in your device.
8) Power on the device.
9) Open the Android App into your Anndroid device.
10) Connect the bluetooth module. i.e HC-05. by clickig on the option HC-05.
